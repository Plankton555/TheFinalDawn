The Final Dawn

Your base is under attack from all sides. Fortify it and defend it from the incoming waves.


Instructions (in alphabetical order):


Attack

You attack an enemy by selecting a unit and then right clicking on an enemy. You could also left click on the Attack ability and then left click again on an unit or building. By using the second method you can also attack yourself.


Build buildings

Select a worker and order it to build a building by left clicking on either "Build Headquarter" or "Build Barracks" and then another left click on an empty space. If you have enough resources the worker will start to construct the building.


Gather Resources

Select a worker and order it to mine gold. This can be done in two ways. Either right click on a gold mine or left click on the "Gather Resource" ability and then left click on the resource. The worker will continue to mine until you tell it not to or it is killed.


Marine

A combat unit with low hit points and mid damage. Its big advantage is its range.


Select a unit or building

Left click on the unit or building you want to select.


Train units

You train units by selecting the appropriate building and then left clicking on the Train ability of your choice. Barracks can train Warriors and Marines and Headquarters can produce workers.


Warrior

A combat unit with a lot of hit points and best damage. It's also the cheapest combat unit. Its biggest drawback is that it needs to get into melee to do damage.


Worker

A unit capable of gathering resources and constructing buildings. Very bad in combat and will not automatically attack an enemy if it is close.
